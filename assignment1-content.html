    <p> &emsp; An English mathematician, codebreaker, philosopher, and computer scientist, 
        Alan Mathison Turing is best known for the "Turing Machine" which is his 1936 paper
    that defines the conceptual framework of a theoretical device which has the ability to manipulate    
    certain symbols according to its rules. 
    </p> 



    <p>&emsp; He is also widely known for the imitation game called the "Turing Test".
        in which this test is a certain approach of identifying whether a machine can have the capability of demonstrating human intelligence.

    <p>&emsp;Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in Maida Vale. During his childhood, he displayed
        signs of unique and high intelligence in which certain teachers from Sherborne School, where Turing studied, noticed it from him.  
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <p> &emsp;When Turing turned 13 years old, he became more interested with the concepts of math and science. After
        complete his studies at Sherborne, Alan Turing enrolled in the university of Cambridge in order to study
        mathematics. Eventually, he was elected as a fellow upon graduation.

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        &emsp;In 1936, Turing delivered a paper which is entitled "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem."
        This paper introduced the idea of a specific machine called Turing Machine (then eventually called as Modern Computer) that has the 
        capability of computing any existing entity that can be computed.

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>
        &emsp;At a span of two years, Alan Turing studied mathematics with the professors at Princeton. He then received 
        his PH.D and returned to Cambridge in 1938 where he took a temporary position to an organization called the 
        Government Code and Cypher School.

    <br>
    <br>


    <p>
        &emsp;By the age of 24, Turing started to work in cracking the Enigma Code which is considered as a 
        very difficult task to carry out. But in 1939, Turing broke the codes of the German Naval and the Air Force.
        Because of his astounding skill in code-breaking, he was then recruited as an Enigma Code breaker for the organization of 
        Government Code and Cypher School, located at Bletchley Park.

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>
        &emsp;Turing also contributed in designing a machine named "Bombe." The contribution made it possible in breaking
        several German ciphers including ones that were utilized by Hitler's headquarters.

    <a name="career-section"></a>
    <h1 class="centertext">Career</h1>
    <p> Alan Turing performed as a codebreaker at Bletchley Park and took a big role in generating outstanding advances 
        in cryptanalysis. He then published two papers that is inlined with breaking codes through mathematical approaches.
      
    </p>
    
    <p>
         Subsequently, Turing started working for the National Physical Laboratory during the time of World War II. His contribution of designing 
         the Automatic Computing Engine was considered as one of his most notable achievements.
    </p>

    <p>
        Turing then became interested in the effects of technology on human behavior. In 1950, Turing proposed an experiment which is called 
        the "Turing Test" that was considered as an imitation game. The objective of the said game is to analyze and observe whether or not a man-made computer can have the capability of having
        intelligence which comes to a point where it can fool a person into thinking that they are interacting with another person itself.

    <h1 class="centertext">Personal Life</h1>

    <h2 class="centertext">Engagement</h2>
    <p> 
        Alan Turing and Joan Clarke were close friends ever since they met and worked at Bletchley Park.
        In terms of Turing's marriage proposal to Joan, it became impermanent due to Turing's characteristic of homosexuality.
    </p>

    <h2 class="centertext">Circumstances</h2>

    <p>
       Things got a bit complicated when Turing met Arnold Murray, a 19 year old boy. Turing invited this boy to lunch and interacted oddly with each other.
       Murray eventually told Turing that they were friends and possibly had a homosexual intimacy within each other. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Police investigations where conducted in terms of Turing and Murray's relationship together. Subsequently, Turing was then convicted
        to plead guilty by the advice of his own solicitor and his brother. In the 31st of March 1952, the case Regina v. Turing and Murray was brought to trial.
        Turing was then convicted and was given a choice between probation or imprisonment. The conviction resulted to numerous issues to Turing himself, this includes
        the removal of his security clearance and the prevention of working into cryptographic consults. Turning was not even allowed to enter the United States and was also prevented 
        to discuss his work related aspects under the Official Secrets Act. 
    
    </p>

    <h2 class="centertext">Death</h2>
    <p>
        Alan Turing died on June 8, 1954. He was found dead by his own housekeeper. Having a basis from the investigations, the determined cause
        of his death was cyanide poisoning. It was assumed that Turing committed suicide by eating a cyanide infused apple. But specific details surrounding his death remain a mystery.

    </p>






<a name="awards-section"></a>
    <h2 class="centertext">Awards and Achievements</h2>

    <p>In 1994, Manchester, the city where Alan Turing worked until the end of his life, named a road in honor before him which was called "Alan Turing Way", then a bridge called Alan Turing Bridge.

    </p>

    <p>
        On June 23, 2001 , a memorial statue of Alan Turing sitting on a bench was unveiled in Manchester. The memorial statue contained a plaque that depicted a text which states
        "Father of Computer Science, Mathematician, Logician, Wartime Codebreaker, Victim of Prejudice" with a quote from Bertrand Russell saying "Mathematics is the science of pure thought.".
    </p>

    <p>
        Time magazine, one of the most popular American magazine and news entity, named Alan Turing as one of the “100 Most Important People of the 20th century.”  
    </p>

    <p>
       The £50 note from the Bank of England unveiled a new design for the note itself which contained a portrait of Alan Turing himself
