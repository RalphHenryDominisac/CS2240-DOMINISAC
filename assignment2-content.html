              &emsp; &emsp;At the time, Sony, the most well-known electronics manufacturer of televisions, radios and mobile phones, decided to enter the video game industry in the mid-'90s. Soy were inspired by the success of  two major players in the field at the time, Nintendo and Sega. Their original idea was not to build their own console, 
                          but to develop the machine with one of the two. However, both  efforts were unsuccessful as Nintendo decided to merge with Dutch manufacturer Philips at the last minute and Sega rejected Sony's approach due to  lack of field experience. 
                                         <br> <br>
                                         Sony decided to build on what it had already done on the Nintendo console, which leverages the processing  and storage capacity of CD-ROMs. They have agreed with several third-party developers such as Namco and Konami to make powerful game choices with the launch of the new console. And at the first Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3)  in 1995, Sony unveiled its original home console, the PlayStation.

        &emsp; &emsp; The history of the PlayStation begins in 1988 as when Sony and Nintendo were working together collaborated to develop the Super Disc. Nintendo was dominating dominated computer gaming at that time. games back then. Sony had not yet hadn't entered the home video game market, market yet, but they were eager keen to make a move. By teaming working with the market leader, they believed they had a good chance for of success.
        <br> <br>
        Only 200 models of the first PlayStation (which could play Super Nintendo game cartridges) were ever made by Sony. The original PlayStation was designed as a multimedia and multipurpose entertainment unit. Aside from being able to play Super Nintendo games, the PlayStation could play audio CDs and read computer and video information CDs. However, these prototypes were scrapped.
  
          <br></br> 

    
          Kutaragi developed games in a 3D polygon graphics format. Not everyone at Sony approved of the PlayStation project and it was moved to Sony Music in 1992, which was a separate entity. They further spun off in 1993 to form Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. (SCEI).
          The new company attracted developers and partners, including Electronic Arts and Namco, who were excited about the 3D-capable, CD-ROM-based console. Compared to the cartridges used by Nintendo, it was easier and cheaper to make CD-ROMs.

             The PlayStation was released in Japan in December 1994 and in the United States in September 1995. Their sales exceeded even the highest expectations, with queues of players queuing outside stores and retailers selling out daily. Subsequent release in Europe and Australia only helped to increase the success, crush the competition and ensure that Sony would now be a major player in the industry. It's worth noting that the PlayStation outperformed its main competitor, the Sega Saturn, by more than three to one within its first year of launch. <br> <br>

             Some of the most famous titles and franchises from the original PlayStations library are the Crash Bandicoot series, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid, Tekken, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, Command & Conquer, Dragon Quest, Gran Turismo, Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat , Persona, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, Silent Hill and Street Fighter. Sony also started the now eponymous trend of annual releases for a wide range of sports titles such as FIFA, NBA Live, Madden, Formula One and others, most of which were published by Electronic Arts (EA).

                    Sony released the PS2 in 2000. Within days, sales of the console were in the millions of units as many players stumbled upon empty store shelves and resorted to spending thousands of dollars through online purchases to find one. <br> <br>

                    The corporation of Sony wanted the PlayStation 2 to offer gamers a better experience through sequels and fresh titles for all of their most popular franchises. They also ensured that the original PlayStation collection would be available to gamers by making the PS2 backward compatible. They also created memory cards (save file holders) with larger storage capacities to keep track of the larger and more complex games their studios were churning out. Another reason for the PS2's success was the fact that it doubled as a DVD player and reached a wider audience..

                Sony's seventh generation console, which entered development in 2001, had a great legacy to follow and big shoes to fill, but it also faced greater resistance. Microsoft had followed its successful first console with the more powerful and faster Xbox 360, while Nintendo remained a strong competitor in the market with the highly innovative Wii. <br> <br>

                Announced at E3 2005, the PlayStation 3 met with skepticism due to its high price compared to its predecessor ($599), but also the fact that it was launched in two editions, one with 20GB storage capacity and one with 60 GB. Not only did the 20GB version have less storage space, it also lacked the HDMI port, flash drive reader, and Wi-Fi internet connection that came with the 60GB version. As if that wasn't enough to cast doubt on customers' minds, Sony decided to push back the first launch date of the consoles in Europe by a few months due to a lack of manufacturing materials..

              The PlayStation 4 entered development in 2008, with four years later Sony sending out kits to all of its main developers to get their input and better understand what they wanted from this new console so they could make their games better and more efficiently . The PS4 was announced at a Sony event called Future Of PlayStation held in February 2013, while the design of the machine itself was kept secret until this year's E3. The new console was released on November 15th in the US and Canada and November 29th in the rest of the world. <br> <br>

              The console offered a greater range of options for players to interact with each other, such as the ability to form social groups based on their interests and events, as well as the ability to start parties and play together while communicating via a headset. Additionally, the new controller (DualShock 4) featured a share button, allowing players to post their achievements or pictures of their in-game adventures to their social media accounts (although the option to share to Facebook was eventually removed). Players can also stream their games live or watch other players from around the world play their favorite titles and leave comments or likes.

              The latest console from Sony is the PlayStation 5, which is another big step forward technologically. The PS4's Achilles' heel was the CPU, which was originally designed for low-end tablets and netbooks. But Sony has made a major upgrade with the PS5, using an octa-core AMD Zen 2 CPU, paired with RDNA2 graphics and 16GB of GDDR6 RAM. <br> <br>

              Perhaps the biggest upgrade comes in the storage area, as the PS5 uses a super-fast 825GB NVMe M.2 custom SSD. This enables lightning-fast load times in games, even in open-world titles. Upcoming titles like Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart also seem to make uniquely impressive use of fast loading times. Sony has also focused on audio with the new console, with something called Tempest Engine technology allowing for more immersive audio effects when used with headphones. The PS5 is available in two variants, with both featuring the same horsepower and 825GB SSD. But the standard model comes with a 4K Blu-ray disc drive for $499, while the $399 variant lacks a physical disc drive and relies on digital downloads only.
